## About the Project

- This project is a simple PCB for an STM32 Nucleo-64 Hat that provides an interface between the hat and an Analog Devices [ADF-702X](https://www.analog.com/en/design-center/evaluation-hardware-and-software/evaluation-boards-kits/eval-adf7021-n.html) development board and a Texas Instruments [CC112X EMK](https://www.ti.com/tool/CC1120EMK-420-470) development board.

The project includes both the Kicad schematic and PCB files, and the STM project for the Nucleo-64 L452RE.
